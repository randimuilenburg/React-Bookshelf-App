      <h2 className="info-h">Welcome to Stranger Reads!</h2>
      <p className="info-p">
        With a group of 10 to 14 members, we meet for two hours on the first
        Monday of every month to discuss novels that are unusual,
        thought-provoking, and outside the ordinary. Our selections emphasize
        fiction that challenges expectations, whether through strange themes,
        experimental styles, or complex ideas, ensuring each conversation is
        lively and engaging.
      </p>
      <p className="info-p">
        Equally important, Stranger Reads is about community. We value not only
        great book discussion but also the friendships and connections built
        along the way. By uplifting diverse voices and exploring a wide range of
        perspectives, we create space for meaningful dialogue and lasting
        relationships, making our meetings both intellectual and social.
