        Stranger Reads is a book club dedicated exclusively to fiction, with a
        focus on titles that expand our sense of what storytelling can do. Our
        criteria for selection focuses on works that are innovative, unusual, or
        boundary-pushing. We look for books that spark curiosity and invite
        members to engage with perspectives outside what is familiar! By
        curating books that have “strange” in themes, structures, or tones, we
        encourage discussion that feels academic and engaging.

        A key part of our approach is choosing books that encourage deeper
        reflection. We look for fiction that raises meaningful questions about
        society, culture, and the human experience. These kinds of stories allow
        us to move beyond plot and into rich discussions that challenge
        assumptions and broaden our world view.

        We also make it a priority to uplift diverse voices. Stranger Reads
        intentionally includes works by authors from a variety of backgrounds,
        ensuring that our reading list reflects a wide spectrum of lived
        experiences and narrative styles. Combined with our focus on fiction,
        this approach helps us create a dynamic reading experience that is both
        challenging and inclusive, while staying true to our mission: to explore
        the strange, the unexpected, and the thought-provoking.
